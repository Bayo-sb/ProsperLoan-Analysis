# Prosper Loan Data Exploration

## by Bayonle Ibukun


## Dataset

The dataset consists of  113937 records of loans and information regarding the loans, about 81 variables was provided on each loan. 


## Summary of Findings

The analysis shows that borrowers who take out larger loans tend to have higher monthly payments, and loans with higher amounts tend to attract more investors. Borrowers with higher incomes and homeowners are more likely to secure higher loan amounts.

There is a fair negative relationship between ProsperScore and Lender Yield, indicating that borrowers with lower ProsperScores may receive higher Lender Yields. Completed loans generally had the lowest lender yield.

The majority of Active loans have higher and more average loan amounts, while past due loans have a smaller range and are skewed. Short-term loans are more likely to be completed compared to other types of loans, but retired or part-time workers tend to have the highest lender yield for loans that are past due.

In terms of loan term, longer-term loans are generally associated with higher loan amounts and lower monthly payments compared to short and middle-term loans. Short-term loans are more likely to be paid off as they have higher monthly payments than middle and long-term loans.

The data also shows a significant number of short-term loans were obtained to finance environmentally friendly projects (i.e., green loans), while a substantial number of long-term loans were obtained for other purposes.



## Key Insights for Presentation

In the presentation, the focus is on analyzing the relationship between loan amount and loan status, as well as the impact of loan term, Prosper score, and Lenderyield on loan amount and loan status. The goal is to identify the factors that determine whether a lender will approve a high loan amount and what determines the status of the loan.
